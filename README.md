# lib-native

This is a simple library that will someday (hopefully) provide a 1 to 1 mapping of the Windows API to JavaScript. This is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use.

# How?

I leverage the [`ffi-rs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffi-rs) library to provide a foreign function interface that allows me to call into the Windows API.

# Why?

I was bored.

# When will this be ready?

Who knows. Probably never. Hopfully someday.
